I am passionate about programming, data science and statistics. I have hands-on experience in developing ML applications end-to-end in Python and I like to invest in well-written code. Letâ€™s connect and explore how my skills can elevate your team!

See [cv](/cv/) for my work experience and education. For research projects that I have contributed or fully written during my studies, see [repositories](/repositories/).
